# Othello

A basic game of [Othello](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english) with a GUI built using pygame. This was my final project developed as part of a Fundamentals of Programming course during my 1st semester of studying Computer Science at UBB Cluj, and also my first time making a GUI (which was truly exciting at that time :)) ).
## Features
- **Basic AI Opponent**: implemented using the *minmax algorithm* with alpha-beta pruning
- **4 Difficulty Levels**
- **Interactive GUI**
- **Option to Switch to CUI** (although the GUI is much prettier :)))

## What I Learned

The FP course was my first interaction with basic software engineering principles. I got to understand the importance of 
- using a **layered architecture** for scalability and easier code maintenance
- writing clean, **readable code** for long-term projects 
- proper **error handling** and **validation techniques**

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Pygame
- **AI Algorithm**: Minmax with alpha-beta pruning
